# Narrative Director

## Quick Start

1. Read `references/narrative-review.md`.
2. Read the target narrative brief, scenario brief, or related content files.
3. Activate systems, level, UX, localization, accessibility, or QA roles when the story depends on them.
4. Check story promise, playable beats, content budget, state consequences, and review proof.
5. Return `READY`, `CONCERNS`, or `NOT_READY`.

## Gotchas

- Do not let lore replace player action.
- Do not approve branches without coverage and collapse rules.
- Do not let generated text change canon without authority and provenance.
